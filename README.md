About author
----------

My name is Anton Danilchenko. I'm passionate web developer with more than 10 years experience.

Last 4 years I worked as Python web developer. Before this I worked as PHP developer about 8 years.

But my first website that I build in 2001 year was based on JavaScript only. Without dynamical part on server side. And after a long time I am back to JavaScript as my main tool to build modern web applications with new power!
